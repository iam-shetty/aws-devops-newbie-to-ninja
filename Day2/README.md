# IAM

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you manage access to your AWS resources. It's like a security system for your AWS account.

IAM allows you to create and manage users, groups, and roles. Users represent individual people or entities who need access to your AWS resources. Groups are collections of users with similar access requirements, making it easier to manage permissions. Roles are used to grant temporary access to external entities or services.

With IAM, you can control and define permissions through policies. Policies are written in JSON format and specify what actions are allowed or denied on specific AWS resources. These policies can be attached to IAM entities (users, groups, or roles) to grant or restrict access to AWS services and resources.

IAM follows the principle of least privilege, meaning users and entities are given only the necessary permissions required for their tasks, minimizing potential security risks. IAM also provides features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security and an audit trail to track user activity and changes to permissions.

By using AWS IAM, you can effectively manage and secure access to your AWS resources, ensuring that only authorized individuals have appropriate permissions and actions are logged for accountability and compliance purposes.

Overall, IAM is an essential component of AWS security, providing granular control over access to your AWS account and resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and helping maintain a secure environment.

## Components of IAM 

Users: IAM users represent individual people or entities (such as applications or services) that interact with your AWS resources. Each user has a unique name and security credentials (password or access keys) used for authentication and access control.

Groups: IAM groups are collections of users with similar access requirements. Instead of managing permissions for each user individually, you can assign permissions to groups, making it easier to manage access control. Users can be added or removed from groups as needed.

Roles: IAM roles are used to grant temporary access to AWS resources. Roles are typically used by applications or services that need to access AWS resources on behalf of users or other services. Roles have associated policies that define the permissions and actions allowed for the role.

Policies: IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. Policies specify the actions that can be performed on AWS resources and the resources to which the actions apply. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles to control access. IAM provides both AWS managed policies (predefined policies maintained by AWS) and customer managed policies (policies created and managed by you).

# Managing Multiple AWS Accounts with IAM Roles

In AWS, IAM roles are pivotal for managing access to various resources securely across different accounts. This guide illustrates how to create IAM roles, assign them to users or instances, and securely copy files to specific S3 buckets.

## Project 1: Assigning IAM Role to an EC2 Instance

### Steps:

1. **Create IAM Role**: 
   - Create a role with permissions for EC2 and full access to S3.
   - Generate an IAM policy granting S3 full access using the policy generator, then apply it as an inline policy to the role.

2. **Deploy EC2 Instance**: 
   - Launch an EC2 instance and attach the created IAM role to it.

3. **Copy File to S3**: 
   - Login to the EC2 instance and use the AWS CLI to copy a file to the desired S3 bucket.

## Project 2: Assigning IAM Role to a User

### Steps:

1. **Modify Trust Policy**:
   - Change the trust inline policy to include additional services like Lambda and Systems Manager (SSM).

2. **Create IAM User**:
   - Create a new IAM user and attach a custom assume role policy allowing the user to assume the created IAM role.

3. **Configure AWS CLI on Instance**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance, install required tools (e.g., unzip, awscli), and configure AWS CLI with access and secret keys.

4. **Check Identity**:
   - Verify the identity using `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

5. **Access S3 Bucket**: 
   - Use the configured user credentials to access and push files to S3 bucket, ensuring security and access control.

## Benefits of Role Assignment to Users:

- Provides granular control over resource access.
- Simplifies permission management and tracking of user actions.
- Enhances security by limiting access to specific resources based on user roles.

## Interview Question: Securely Copying File to Specific S3 Bucket

Q: How would you copy a file to a specific S3 bucket from an EC2 instance without using access and secret keys?

A: 
1. Create an IAM role without granting S3 full access.
2. Generate a custom IAM policy allowing access only to the specific S3 bucket using its ARN.
3. Attach the inline policy to the IAM role.
4. Assign the IAM role to the EC2 instance.
5. Use AWS CLI on the instance to copy files to the specified S3 bucket.
